# Sponge City Oriented Notebook Collection 
- With plenty of plot elements from the great bqplot work. Which is an interactive 2-D plotting tool and in this context spiced with a schedulable compute node test library for Alibaba project

## Introduction

bqplot is a 2-D visualization system for Jupyter, based on the constructs of
the *Grammar of Graphics*. In the examples folder project specific notebooks and content is added

## Two APIs are provided

- Users can build custom visualizations using the internal object model, which
  is inspired by the constructs of the Grammar of Graphics (figure, marks, axes,
  scales), and enrich their visualization with our Interaction Layer.
- Or they can use the context-based API similar to Matplotlib's pyplot, which
  provides sensible default choices for most parameters.

### Dependencies
